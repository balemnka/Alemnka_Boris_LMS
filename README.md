This is the Software implementation phase of this project.
The implementation keeps failing, so I am doing a lot of troubleshootinh to get it to work
THis is just a submission of what I have right now, whish I think is okay, since we are going into the testing phase next
I will be able to continue testing and fixing any errors so I can get it right by the final due date.
This is why I am behind on this project
The intended purpose and functionality of this is to be able to add a book to the database, remove a book, check out, and check in a book.
With each of these functions should be a confirmation message.
